# Caddy UI

A modern, self-hosted web UI for [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) — manage proxy hosts, redirections, SSL certificates, and advanced routes through a clean interface, without touching config files.

## Features

- **Proxy Hosts** — point domains at upstream services with one-click TLS via Caddy's automatic HTTPS
- **Redirections** — 301/302/307/308 redirect rules across hostnames
- **Advanced Routes** — import raw Caddyfile blocks or write JSON directly for anything the UI can't model
- **Certificates** — manage custom PEM/path certificates; expiry alerts via email and/or webhook
- **Multi-server** — manage multiple Caddy instances from a single UI; switch with a dropdown
- **Multi-user** — admin and user roles; each user sees and manages only their own proxies
- **Email notifications** — SMTP support (STARTTLS / TLS / plain) for cert-expiry and upstream health alerts
- **Upstream health** — live health check per proxy; polls Caddy's own admin API so Docker-internal hostnames work correctly
- **Activity log** — every create/edit/delete/sync action is logged with actor and timestamp
- **Snapshots** — one-click SQLite database backup; auto-snapshot on sync
- **Import from Caddy** — pull your existing live Caddy config into the DB on first run
- **Paste Caddyfile** — convert a Caddyfile block into a managed advanced route
- **Dark mode** — toggleable, remembers your choice; system preference respected on first visit
- **2FA / TOTP** — per-user time-based one-time passwords
- **PWA** — installable on desktop and mobile; offline-capable service worker
- **Update notifications** — sidebar badge when a newer Docker Hub release is available

## Quick Start

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    image: caddy:2-alpine
    container_name: caddyui-caddy
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      - "443:443/udp"
    volumes:
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config
    environment:
      CADDY_ADMIN: 0.0.0.0:2019
    command: caddy run --config /config/caddy/autosave.json --resume --adapter json
    networks:
      - caddyui

  caddyui:
    image: applegater/caddyui:latest
    container_name: caddyui
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - caddy
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
    volumes:
      - caddyui_data:/data
    environment:
      CADDYUI_DB: /data/caddyui.db
      CADDYUI_LISTEN: :8080
      CADDY_ADMIN_URL: http://caddy:2019
    networks:
      - caddyui

volumes:
  caddy_data:
  caddy_config:
  caddyui_data:

networks:
  caddyui:
    driver: bridge
```

Open **http://localhost:8081** and complete the first-run setup (create an admin account).

### Docker Run (standalone)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name caddyui \
  -p 8081:8080 \
  -v caddyui_data:/data \
  -e CADDY_ADMIN_URL=http://your-caddy-host:2019 \
  applegater/caddyui:latest
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CADDYUI_DB` | `/data/caddyui.db` | Path to the SQLite database |
| `CADDYUI_LISTEN` | `:8080` | Listen address |
| `CADDY_ADMIN_URL` | `http://caddy:2019` | Caddy admin API base URL |
| `CADDYFILE_PATH` | `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` | Path to Caddyfile (optional) |
| `CADDYUI_SYNC_ON_START` | *(unset)* | Set to `1` to push DB state to Caddy on startup |

---

## Configuration

All configuration is done through the web UI. No config files needed beyond the environment variables above.

### First Run

1. Open the UI at your configured port.
2. Create the first admin account via the setup wizard.
3. The bootstrap Caddy server is automatically added (using `CADDY_ADMIN_URL`).
4. Add additional Caddy servers under **System → Caddy Servers**.

### SMTP Notifications

Configure under **System → Settings → Email (SMTP)**:

- Supports STARTTLS (port 587), implicit TLS (port 465), and plain (port 25)
- Cert-expiry emails fire once per 24 h per domain when within the configured threshold
- Upstream health emails fire on state change (healthy → down, down → recovered), checked every 5 minutes

### Multi-Server

Add additional Caddy instances under **System → Caddy Servers**. Switch the active server with the dropdown in the sidebar. All proxy hosts, redirections, routes, and certificates are scoped per server.

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/X4Applegate/caddyui.git
cd caddyui
go build -o caddyui ./cmd/caddyui
./caddyui
```

### Docker Build

```bash
docker build --build-arg VERSION=v1.0.0 -t caddyui:v1.0.0 .
```

### Dependencies

- [Go 1.22+](https://go.dev/)
- [Caddy 2.x](https://caddyserver.com/) with the admin API enabled (default)
- No external database required — uses embedded SQLite

## Architecture

```
cmd/caddyui/        Entry point, env config, startup
internal/
  auth/             Session, password hashing, TOTP
  caddy/            Admin API client, Caddyfile parser, importer
  db/               SQLite init & migrations
  models/           Data types and DB queries
  server/           HTTP handlers, routes, notifiers, health poller
web/
  templates/        Go html/template pages
  static/           CSS, icons, PWA manifest & service worker
```

CaddyUI stores all state in a single SQLite file. It communicates with Caddy exclusively through Caddy's HTTP admin API — no SSH, no file manipulation.

---

## Upgrading

1. Pull the new image tag from Docker Hub.
2. Recreate the container (Portainer: **Recreate** → enable **Re-pull image**; CLI: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`).
3. Database migrations run automatically on startup.
4. Check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for any breaking changes.
